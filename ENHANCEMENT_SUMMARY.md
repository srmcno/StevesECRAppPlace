## ⚠️ Action Items Required

### 1. Add ECR Housing Sites Data Source
The "ECR Housing Sites" library needs to be manually connected in Power Apps Studio:

**Steps:**
1. Open `ECR Data Collector - Enhanced.msapp` in Power Apps Studio
2. Go to **Data** → **Add data**
3. Select **SharePoint**
4. Connect to: `https://choctawnationofoklahoma.sharepoint.com/sites/environmentalcompliance`
5. Select the library: **ECR Housing Sites**
6. Click **Connect**

**Columns to verify:**
- Housing_x0020_Site (Lookup to Facility Contact List)
- Review Date
- Housing Site: City, Contact Email, County, Zip Code, District (Lookup columns)

### 2. Create Housing ECR Screen
A full Housing ECR screen needs to be created with 55 housing-specific questions. I've provided the complete question set in `QUESTION_SETS_REFERENCE.md`.

**Option A - Quick Implementation:**
Modify the existing `scrAudit.pa.yaml` to show housing-specific questions when `gblIsHousingECR = true`.

**Option B - Separate Screen (Recommended):**
Create `scrHousingAudit.pa.yaml` as a dedicated housing audit screen with all 55 questions from the reference document.

**Housing Question Categories:**
1. Property & Site Condition (8 questions)
2. Waste Management (7 questions)
3. Water & Septic Systems (8 questions)
4. Hazardous Materials & Safety (10 questions)
5. Mold & Moisture Control (6 questions)
6. Heating & Cooling Systems (5 questions)
7. Environmental Compliance (6 questions)
8. Occupant Safety & Education (5 questions)

### 3. Test All Workflows
Once the Housing ECR screen is added:
- ✅ Test Desktop Review → Save → Verify in SharePoint
- ✅ Test AST Review → Save → Verify in SharePoint
- ⚠️ Test Housing ECR → Save → Verify in SharePoint
- ✅ Test Standard ECR → Verify Desktop Review auto-loads
- ⚠️ Test Housing ECR → Verify it uses Housing Sites library

## 📊 Key Features Implemented

### Auto-Population Logic
When a facility is selected for an ECR audit, the application:
1. Searches for Desktop Reviews from the past 90 days
2. If found, loads the data into `gblDesktopReviewData`
3. Displays success notification to auditor
4. Makes data available for pre-population during audit

### Scoring Systems
- **Desktop Review**: Informational only (no score)
- **Standard ECR**: 100 - (Major × 15) - (Minor × 5)
- **Housing ECR**: 100 - (Major × 10) - (Minor × 3)
- **AST Review**: 100 - (Major × 15) - (Minor × 5)

### Question Navigation
- **Desktop Review**: Tab-based section navigation
- **AST Review**: Category-based navigation with horizontal scroll
- **Housing ECR**: (To be implemented) Section-based tabs similar to Desktop Review

---

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### Visual Improvements
- **Color-coded buttons**: Different colors for each audit type
  - Blue: CNO Facilities ECR
  - Blue: Housing ECR
  - Light Blue: Desktop Review
  - Orange: AST/SPCC Review
- **Icons**: Emoji-based icons for quick identification
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to phone, tablet, and desktop
- **Modern shadows and borders**: Professional appearance
- **Consistent theming**: Uses global theme variables

### User Experience
- **Search functionality**: All facility dropdowns have search
- **Multi-select**: Tank selection supports multiple items
- **Progress indicators**: Clear visual feedback on completion
- **Validation**: Disabled save buttons until required fields complete
- **Notifications**: Success/error messages for all save operations

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### SharePoint Integration
All screens save data to their respective SharePoint lists using Patch() operations with proper OData type formatting:

```powerapps
{
    '@odata.type': "#Microsoft.Azure.Connectors.SharePoint.SPListExpandedReference",
    Id: value.ID,
    Value: value.Title
}
```

### Collection Management
- `colDesktopQuestions` - Desktop review questions
- `colASTQuestions` - AST/SPCC questions
- `colFacilityTanks` - Tanks for selected facility
- `colFacilities` - All facilities (existing)
- `colPreviousFindings` - Unresolved findings (existing)

### Error Handling
All data operations use:
- `IfError()` for data loading
- `With()` for scoped variables
- `IsBlank()` checks before saves
- Notify() for user feedback
