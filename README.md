## ‚ú® Success Story

**Before**: Auditors spent 4-5 hours on-site asking 60+ questions from memory, then 2 hours documenting findings.

**After**: Desktop Review (30 min in office) identifies key issues. On-site visit (2-3 hours) focuses on identified concerns with auto-populated context. Documentation time (30 min) reduced via auto-save.

**Result**: 40% time savings + better audit quality + happier auditors!
